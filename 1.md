# 1. Getting started - Printing our name

## Basic form

A very basic Java program looks like this:

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // this is a comment
  }
}
```

For the moment ignore everything except line three. 

We will explain the other lines in later lessons.

For now we will program on line three.

## Comments

**Comments** are lines Java ignores.

Comments start with two forward slashes: `//`. 

We use them to keep notes about a program. Or to help a friend understand our program.

Another way to write them is: `/* This is a comments */`

## Printing and Strings

In Java a piece of text is called a **string**.

A **string** must be surrounded by double quotation marks: `"Hello"`.

*Only* strings are surrounded by quotation marks.

When we want to print a string we must do five things:

0. Type `System.out.println`
0. Then an opening parenthesis
0. Then a string
0. Then a closing parenthsis
0. Then, finally, a **semi-colon**.

**code sample 1.0**

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello world!");
  }
}
```

## Statements and semi-colons

A **statement** is an instruction you give to Java.

For example, "Print a string".

Every statement *must* end with a **semi-colon**: `;`

We know only one statement at the moment: `System.out.println("Hi!");`

We can have a program with many statements:

**code sample 1.1**

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello world!");
    System.out.println("I am awake!");
  }
}
```

80% of all lines you will type will end in a semi-colon. Don't forget them!
