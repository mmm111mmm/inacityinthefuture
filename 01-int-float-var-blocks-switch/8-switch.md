# 8. A little logic

If it's raining outside, you wear a coat. But if it's sunny and hot outside, you wear a t-shirt.

This is simple logic. And Java supports it.

## Our first logic statement: `switch`

Java has a statement called `switch`.

`switch` looks at a variable. Let's say it looks at a string variable called `weather`.

`switch` looks at **cases** of a variable. This means: 

* in the case `weather` is `"Raining"`, it does something.
* but in the case `weather` is `"SunnyAndHot"`, it does something else.

## Switch is a block statement

Our other statements were: printing, defining a variable and assigning a variable.

These are all single statments.

But `switch` has multiple statements: one in the case `weather` is `"Raining"`, another if `weather` is something else, etc.

## Next...

```
switch(weather) {
}
```

Introduce case.

Introduce break.

Introduce default.
