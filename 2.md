# 2. Data - Printing some numbers, printing the truth

This lesson deals with: logic and data, types, integers, floats, booleans.

## Data and logic

In human language we have two main things: nouns and verbs.

Verbs are actions. For example, drink, smash, turn on, sit, etc.

Nouns are things. For example, a cup, a plate, a chainsaw, the table, etc.

In a computer prgoram we have two main things: logic and data.

## Logic

Logic is instructions.

An example:

* If you are late for work in the morning, you run to the u-bahn. If you are not late for work, you walk to the u-bahn.

We will look at logic in a few lessons.

## Data

When we say **data** we mean things like numbers and text. We previously wrote this program:

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello world!");
  }
}
```

In this program we printed some data. We printed a string.

## A data type

Java can use different kinds of data. These different kinds are called **types**.

We already know one type: a string.

## The int (or integer) data type

Let's learn another data type.

Whole numbers are: -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. We call these integers.

Unlike strings, we do no surround **int**s with anything.

Here's how we print an integer: 

**code sample 2.0:**

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(42);
  }
}
```

## The float (or floating point) data type

Floating point numbers are: 0.1, 0.2, 0.666667, 14.2, 3.14, 9.9, etc

As with ints, **floats** are not surrounded with anything.

Here's how we print an integer: 

**code sample 2.1:**

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(3.1415);
  }
}
```

## The boolean data type

There was a man called George Bool. Some people named a data type after him.

A **boolean** can only be two things. It can either be **true** or **false**.

This comes in very useful in later lesson when look at logic.

As with ints and floats, **boolean**s are not surrounded with anything.

Here's how we print booleans: 

**code sample 2.2:**

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(true);
    System.out.println(false);
  }
}
```
