# 4. Changing data - Varying data

We currently print data directly:

**code sample 4.0**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("My age is: " + 42 + ".");
  }
}
```

## We need to change data

However, programs need to change data.

A computer game needs to print your score, do something, then print the new score.

A banking program needs to print your balance, withdraw money from your account, then print your new balance.

## Introducing variables

We can say we need to change data. Or we need to **vary** data.

If we want to vary data, we need to use **variables**.

## What does a variable look like?

A variable consists of two things:

0. A data type
0. A name

We looked at data types previously: a string, an int, a float, a bool.

The name can be anything you want.

For example: `String name` or `int age`.

. a
. b 
. c
. d 
. e
. f


# Changing data - Changing your name and age

This lesson deals with: ++ numbers, -- numbers, + numbers, - numbers, + strings, printing and assignment.
