* Banking software
* Many, many other things

## Why should I learn Java?

You should learn many languages, not only Java.  

You should learn one major language very well, such as Java. 

Then others will be easy.

## So, what is Java?

A Java *file* is a text file. It looks like this:

```java
class Main {
  public static main() {
    System.out.println("Hello, world!");
  }
}
```

It contains instructions for the computer.

But a computer only understands naughts and ones (e.g. 10101011)

So a Java **compiler** converts these instructions into naughts and ones.

A computer then **runs** (or **executes**) those instructions.

## How do I compile?

You will use another program.

It will have button labelled 'go' or 'compile'.

It will compile your Java file and also run it.
