# 6. Making decisions with booleans 

We use **"if statements"** everyday: "If it is raining, take an umbrella." 

And in Java too. 

## If statement

`if` statements are block statements like `switch` statements. This means they start an end with `{` and `}`.

And an `if` statement takes a boolean:

**code sample 1_6_0
```java
class Main {
  public static void(String[] args) {
    boolean raining = true;
    if(raining) {
      System.out.println("You should take an umbrella.");
    }
  }
}
```

The output is:
```
You should take an umbrella.
```

## If statement with an else statement

If `raining` is false then the `if` statement is skipped (so nothing is printed).


## And if-else statement
