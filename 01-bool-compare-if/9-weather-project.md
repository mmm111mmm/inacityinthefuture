# 9. Weather project

We have learnt about 

* booleans
* combining booleans
* using parentheses with booleans
* making booleans from number comparisons
* if statements
* if-else statements
* else statements.

## The weather project

We will create a project that looks at the weather and tells us if we should:

* wear a coat or not
* take an umbrella or not
* wear shorts or jeans
* wear sunglasses or not

For the morning, afternoon and evening.

## Weather data

We can get the weather data from the internet. But we have not learnt enough Java for that yet.

So we will use booleans at the moment. In later lessons we will learn how to get the weather data from the internet.

Then we will update this project.
