# 4. Telling Java about your data

We currently print data without changing it:

**code sample 4.0**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("My age is: " + 36 + ".");
  }
}
```

But computer programs need to change data. For example, your score in a computer game.

When you need to change data, you need to first tell Java about your data.

This lesson will talk about telling Java about your data.

## Introducing variables

We need to tell Java about data that will change. 

Another way to say that is: we need to tell Java about data that will *vary*.

When we need to *vary* data, we use **variables**.

## What is a variable made of?

A variable is made of two things:

0. A variable data type
0. A variable name

We looked at data types previously: string, int, float, boolean.

A variable name can be anything you want.

## Declaring a variable

We say we **declare** a variable when we tell Java about the variable's *data type* and *name*.

A computer program will contain many **declarations**.

## What does a variable type look like?

We know four types of data: a string, a int, a float and a boolean.

* An int variable looks like this: `int something`
* An float variable looks like this: `float something`
* A boolean variable looks like this: `boolean something`
* A string variable looks like this: `String something`

*Note* that a string has a **uppercase** S. In later lessons, we will explain why.

## What can I name my variable?

We said it can be whatever you want. But:

* It must start with a letter: `String hello`.
* It can include **underscores**: `String _hello`.
* And it *must not* include spaces: `String helloIAmALongerName`.
* And it can include numbers, but *not* at the beginning: `String hello43`.

## Examples

If we want to tell Java about a string variable, named `hello`:

```java
String hello;
```

If we want to tell Java about an int variable, named `age`:

```java
int age;
```

If we want to tell Java about a float variable, named `score`:

```java
float score;
```

If we want to tell Java about a boolean variable, named `happy`:

```java
boolean happy;
```

When we tell Java about a variable, we make a **statement**. And you end statements with a semi-colon, `;`.

## How can we put data in our variable?

We know how to **declare** a variable. It now needs a **value** (e.g. "Aaron", 36, etc).

When we give a variable a value, we **assign** a value to variable. 

We use the variable name, then a space, then the equals sign, `=`, then the value.

For example, if you create a string variable called `name`, you can do:

```java
name = "Aaron";
```

If you create a int variable called `age`, you can do:

```java
age = 36;
````

If you create a boolean variable called `happy`, you can do:

```java
happy = true;
````

If you create a float variable called `score`, you can do:

```java
score = 10.50;
````

Assigning a variable is a statement. And you end a statement with a semi-colon, `;`.

## Printing the variable

We declared a variable. And we assigned a value to the variable. 

We can now use the variable name to print it.

**code sample 4.1**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int age;
    age = 36;
    System.out.println("My age is: " + age);
  }
}
```

## We can declare a variable ONLY ONCE

When you declare a variable, you tell Java about it and give it a name.

If you try to **declare** two variables with **same** name, Java will get confused. It will not work.

**code sample 4.2**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // THE BELOW WILL NOT WORK!!!!!!
    String name;
    String name;
  }
}
```

## We can assign a value to a variable many times

When we assign a variable, we give the variable a value.

We can do this many times

**code sample 4.3**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int age;
    age = 36;
    System.out.println("One year passes.");
    age = 37;
    System.out.println("One year passes.");
    age = 38;
    System.out.println("My age is now: " + age);
  }
}
```

The output is:

```
My age is now: 38
```

## We can declare and assign a variable at the same time

We often declare and assign a variable on the same line.

For example: `String name = "Aaron";`.

The above program is exactly the same as above:

**code sample 4.4**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int age = 36;
    System.out.println("One year passes.");
    age = 37;
    System.out.println("One year passes.");
    age = 38;
    System.out.println("My age is now: " + age);
  }
}
```
