# 2. Data - Printing some numbers, printing the truth

## Data

In the last lesson we printed a string.

But Java can deal with other types of data.

When we talk about the type of data (a number, a string, etc) we talk about a **data type**.

We've already learn one data data: a string.

## The int data type

Let's learn another data type.

Whole numbers are: -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. We call these ints (or integers).

Here's how we print an int: 

**code sample 2.0:**

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(42);
  }
}
```

## The float data type

Floats are: 0.1, 0.2, 0.666667, 14.2, 3.14, 9.9, etc.

(We can also call these floating point numbers.)

Here's how we print an float: 

**code sample 2.1:**

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(3.1415);
  }
}
```

## The boolean data type

There was a man called George Bool. Some people named a data type after him.

A **boolean** can only be two things. It can either be **true** or **false**.

This comes in very useful in later lesson when look at logic.

Here's how we print booleans: 

**code sample 2.2:**

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(true);
    System.out.println(false);
  }
}
```
