# 8. A little logic

If it's raining outside, you wear a coat. But if it's sunny and hot outside, you wear a t-shirt.

This is simple logic. And Java supports it.

## Our first logic statement: `switch`

Java has a statement called `switch`.

`switch` looks at a variable, a string variabled named `weather`, for example.

Then `switch` looks at **cases** of a variable. This means: 

* In the case `weather` is `"Raining"`, it does something.
* But in the case `weather` is `"SunnyAndHot"`, it does something else.
* Etc.

## Switch is a block statement 

We previously learnt single statements: printing, defining a variable and assigning a variable.

But `switch` has multiple statements: one in the case `weather` is `"Raining"`, another if `weather` is something else, etc.

We use **curly brackets**, `{ }`, to mark the beginning and end of the multiple statements.

We say we use a **block statement** when we have multiple statements.

So far our `switch` looks like this:

```java
switch(weather) {
  ...
}
```

## Cases



Introduce break.

Introduce default.
