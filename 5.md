# 4. Giving your data a value

## How can we put data in our variable?

We know how to **declare** a variable. It now needs a **value** (e.g. "Aaron", 36, etc).

When we give a variable a value, we **assign** a value to variable. 

When we assign a value to a variable, the variable and value *must* have the same data type (`int` and `36`, `String` and `"Aaron"` for example). If it does not, Java will complain. A lot!

When we assign we use the variable name, then a space, then the equals sign, `=`, then the value.

For example, we assign "Aaron" to the `name` variable by writing:

```java
name = "Aaron";
```

For example, we assign `36` to the `age` variable by writing:

```java
age = 36;
````

For example, we assign `true` to the `happy` variable by writing:


```java
happy = true;
````

For example, we assign `10.50` to the `score` variable by writing:

```java
score = 10.50;
````

Assigning a variable is a statement. And you end a statement with a semi-colon, `;`.

## Printing the variable

We declared a variable. And we assigned a value to the variable. 

We can now use the variable name to print it.

**code sample 4.1**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int age;
    age = 36;
    System.out.println("My age is: " + age);
  }
}
```

This will output:

```
My age is: 36
```

## We can declare a variable ONLY ONCE

If you try to **declare** two variables with **same** name, Java will get confused. Java will complain. A lot!

**code sample 4.2**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // THE BELOW WILL NOT WORK!!!!!!
    String name;
    String name;
  }
}
```

## We can assign a value to a variable many times

We can change (or vary) our data by assigning a new value to it.

For example:

**code sample 4.3**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int age;
    age = 36;
    System.out.println("One year passes.");
    age = 37;
    System.out.println("One year passes.");
    age = 38;
    System.out.println("My age is now: " + age);
  }
}
```

The output is:

```
My age is now: 38
```

## We can declare and assign a variable at the same time

We often declare and assign a variable on the same line.

For example: `String name = "Aaron";`.

The above program is exactly the same as above:

**code sample 4.4**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int age = 36;
    System.out.println("One year passes.");
    age = 37;
    System.out.println("One year passes.");
    age = 38;
    System.out.println("My age is now: " + age);
  }
}
```
