# 7. Changing a int

We learnt how to declare a int variable. And we learnt how to assign value to that variable.

We also learnt how to assign a value to an int variable multiple times:

**code sample 7.0**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int age = 36;
    System.out.println(age);
    age = 112;
    System.out.println(age);
  }
}
```

## Adding to an int with `+`

We can add to an int with `+`.

**code sample 7.1**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int age = 36;
    System.out.println(age);
    age = age + 10;
    System.out.println(age);
  }
}
```

This outputs 

```
36
46
```

## Substrcting from an int with `-`

We can substract from an int with `-`.

**code sample 7.3**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int age = 36;
    System.out.println(age);
    age = age - 10;
    System.out.println(age);
  }
}
```

This outputs 

```
36
26
```
