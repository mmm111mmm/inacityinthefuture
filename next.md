# 4. Changing data - Varying data

We currently print data directly:

**code sample 4.0**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("My age is: " + 36 + ".");
  }
}
```

## We need to change data

However, programs need to change data.

A computer game needs to print your score, do something, then print the new score.

A banking program needs to print your balance, withdraw money from your account, then print your new balance.

## Introducing variables

We can say we need to change data. Or we need to **vary** data.

If we want to vary data, we need to use **variables**.

## What does a variable look like?

A variable consists of two things:

0. A data type
0. A name

We looked at data types previously: a string, an int, a float, a bool.

Java needs to know the **type** of data.

The name can be anything you want.

For example: `String name` or `int age`.

## What does a variable type look like?

We know four types of data: a string, a int, a float and a bool.

* When we want to specify a int variable, we say: `int something`
* When we want to specify a float variable, we say: `float something`

*But*:

* When we want to specify a bool variable, we say: `boolean something`
* When we want to specify a string variable, we say: `String something`

Note that a string has a **uppercase** S. And that a bool is **boolean**.

In later lessons, we will explain why string has an uppercase S.

## What can I name my variable?

We said it can be whatever you want.

But 

* It must start with a letter: `String hello`.
* Or it can start with an **underscore**: `String _hello`.
* And it must include no spaces: `String helloIAmALongerName`.
* And it can include numbers, but not at the beginning: `String hello43`.

This lesson deals with: ++ numbers, -- numbers, + numbers, - numbers, + strings, printing and assignment.
