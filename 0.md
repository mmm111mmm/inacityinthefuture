# 0. Getting started - What is Java?

This lesson deals with: compiing, statements, strings, printing.

## What is Java?

When you talk to a Swede, you must speak Swedish.

When you talk to a computer, you must speak a language that it understands. 

Java is one of these languages.

Sometimes we say "tell Java to do x, y or z". For example "Tell Java to print some text".

## What is Java used for?

All kinds of things: 

* Games such as Minecraft
* Mobile phone apps such as Android apps
* Banking software
* Many, many other things

## Why should I learn Java and not another language?

You should learn many languages. You must start with one, and learn that well.

Once you learn one major computer language well, such as Java, others will be easy.

## What is a Java program?

A computer program is like Microsoft Word, Apple Mail, Tetris, Minecraft.

A Java program is a computer program written in Java.

## What is compiling?

We write Java in a text file.

We then **compile** that file. 

When we compile it, it is converted into noughts and ones (010101010010...). 

You can then **run** this. 

When we run it, it can do anything we want - show some graphics, load an address book, open a file, play some music.

## What do we mean when we talk about the compiler?

When we talk about **a compiler** we mean something that takes the Java code and converts it into a naughts and ones.

Sometimes we use the term **Java**, **the Java compiler** and **the compiler** interchanagably. 

For example, 

* "Java does not understand this line"
* "The compiler does not understand this line"
* "The Java compiler does not understand this line" 

all mean the same thing.

## How do we compile?

Another computer program helps us. 

We just press a button - labelled go or run - and the Java file is compiled and run for us.
