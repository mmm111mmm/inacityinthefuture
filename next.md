## The boolean data type

There was a man called George Bool. Some people named a data type after him.

A **boolean** can only be two things. It can either be **true** or **false**.

This will be very useful later when we look at logic.

Here's how we print booleans: 


**code sample 2.2:**

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(true);
    System.out.println(false);
  }
}
```

0. What is a bool? Give two examples.
0. Give an example of a boolean variable.
0. Give an example of a boolean value.
0. Give an example of assigning a boolean value to a variable.


For example, we assign `true` to the `happy` variable by writing:


```java
happy = true;
````
