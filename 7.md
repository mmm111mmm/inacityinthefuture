# 7. Changing an int and a float

We learnt how to declare an int variable. And we learnt how to assign a value to that int.

We also learnt how to assign a value to an int variable multiple times:

**code sample 7.0**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int age = 36;
    System.out.println(age);
    age = 112;
    System.out.println(age);
  }
}
```

## Adding to an int with `+`

We can add to an int with `+`.

We type the variable name, then a `+` and then a int value: `age + 10`. This makes the value `47`.

Then we assign that to a variable: `age = age + 10`. 

In this case, we replace the existing value in `age`.

For example:

**code sample 7.1**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int age = 36;
    System.out.println(age);
    age = age + 10;
    System.out.println(age);
  }
}
```

This outputs 

```
36
46
```

## Subtracting from an int with `-`

We can substract from an int with `-`.

**code sample 7.3**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int age = 36;
    System.out.println(age);
    age = age - 10;
    System.out.println(age);
  }
}
```

This outputs 

```
36
26
```

## Adding to a float with `+`

We can add to a float in the same way: with a `+`.

Then we assign that to a variable: `score = score + 2.1`. 

In this case, we replace the existing value in `score`.

**code sample 8.1**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    float score = 10.5;
    System.out.println(score);
    score = score + 2.1;
    System.out.println(score);
  }
}
```

This outputs 

```
10.5
12.7
```

## Subtracting from a float with `-`

We can substract from a float with `-`.

**code sample 8.2**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    float score = 10.5;
    System.out.println(score);
    score = score - 2.1;
    System.out.println(score);
  }
}
```

This outputs 

```
10.5
8.4
```
