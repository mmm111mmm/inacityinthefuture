# 4. Storing data

We currently print data directly:

**code sample 4.0**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("My age is: " + 42 + ".");
  }
}
```

However programs need to change data.

A computer game needs to print your score, do something, then print the new score.

A banking program needs to print your balance, withdraw money from your account, then print your new balance.

To change data we need to use *variables*.

## Introducing variables

Another phrase for to change data, is **to vary** data.

If we want to vary data, we need to use **variables**.

## What is a variable?

A variable consists of two things:

0. A data type
0. A name

The data type is one we looked at previously: a string, an int, a float, a bool.

The name can be anything you want.

For example: `String name` or `int age`.
