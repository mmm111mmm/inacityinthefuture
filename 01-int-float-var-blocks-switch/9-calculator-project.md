## 9. Calculator project

In this module, we learnt:

* How to declare a variables
* How to assign a value to a variable
* How to do simple maths
* How to use a `switch` statement.

We will create a simple calculator project to practice all those thing.

## User input

Someone normally uses a calculator by typing numbers into the keyboard.

We have not learnt how to do this. But in later lessons we will. And then we will update this project.

But for now, we will insert the numbers into the java program and press `run` or `compile` to see the answer.

## Design of the program

Our design will be simple.

First, we will declare and assign three variables:

0. An int number named `number1` with a value (`3` for example`).
0. A string named `operator` with a value (`*` for example).
0. An int number named `number2` with a value (`2` for example`).

After that, we will declare a `switch` statement that looks at the `operator` variable:

0. In the case that `operator` is `"+"`, we will print out `number1` plus `number2`.
0. In the case that `operator` is `"*"`, we will print out `number1` multiplied by `number2`.
0. In the case that `operator` is `"%"`, we will print out `number1` divided by `number2`.
0. In the default case, we will print `"Sorry I don't understand"`.

## Running the program

When you change the `number1`, `operator` and `number2` variables, you should get a different output.

## Congratulations

You practiced everything we learnt in this module!
