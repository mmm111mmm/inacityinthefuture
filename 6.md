# 5. Changing a string

We learnt how to declare a string variable. And we learnt how to assign value to that variable.

We also learnt how to assign a value to a variable multiple times:

**code sample 6.0**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String status = "I am fine";
    System.out.println(status);
    status = "I am even better";
    System.out.println(status);
  }
}
```

## Concatenating a value with `+`

We can also change a string using **concatenation** (which we learnt in a previous lesson).

We can use the variable name, then a `+` and then a new string: `status + " and healthy"`.

This makes the string `"I am even better and healthy"`. 

We then assign that to a variable: `status = status + " and healthy";`.

**code sample 6.1**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String status = "I am fine";
    System.out.println(status);
    status = status + " and healthy";
    System.out.println(status);
  }
}
```

The output is:

```
I am fine
I am fine and healthy
```

## Using `+=` to concatenate

We saw the code `status = status + " and healthy"`.

This means 

* get the value of `status` (`"I am fine"`)
* add the string `" and healthy"` to the end
* assign that to the variable `status`.

This is a very common thing to do. So Java has a shortcut: `status += " and healthy"`.

For example this program:

**code sample 6.2**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String status = "I am fine";
    System.out.println(status);
    status = status + " and healthy";
    System.out.println(status);
  }
}
```

outputs the same as the previous program:

```
I am fine
I am fine and healthy
```


## Concatenating a string with another type

As we saw before, we can concatenate a value with another type.

*But* only if the string is first:

**code sample 5.2**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String status = "My age is...";
    System.out.println(status);
    status = status + 36;
    System.out.println(status);
  }
}
```

The output is:

```
My age is...
My age is...36
```
