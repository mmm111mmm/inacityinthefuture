# 1. Getting started - Printing our name

## Instructions (or statements)

We said a Java program contains instructions for the computer.

We call these instructions **statements**. Around 75% of all code is statements. 

In Java every statement ends with a semi-colon, `;`. Remember this fact!

## Basic form of Java

Before we learn our first statement, we will look at the basic form of Java:

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ...
  }
}
```

There is a lot here we don't understand.

We will learn about it all in later lessons.

For this lesson we will start coding on line three.

We will ignore the rest for the moment.

## Our first statment: printing

We will learn many statements.

We will learn how to print to the screen.

## Printing and Strings

In Java a piece of text is called a **string**.

A **string** must be surrounded by double quotation marks: `"Hello"`.

*Only* strings are surrounded by quotation marks.

We are going to **print** this string. This means we are going to display this string on the screen.

When we want to print a string we must do five things:

0. Type `System.out.println`
0. Then an opening parenthesis, `(`
0. Then a string
0. Then a closing parenthsis, `)`
0. Then, finally, a **semi-colon**, `;`

**code sample 1.0**

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello world!");
  }
}
```

## Comments

**Comments** are lines Java ignores.

Comments start with two forward slashes: `//`. 

We use them to keep notes about a program. Or to help a friend understand our program.

Another way to write them is: `/* This is a comments */`
