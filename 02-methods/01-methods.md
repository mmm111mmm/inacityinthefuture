# What does a method look like?

You know what they look like. You've written them lots of times. But you don't know you know. 

Look at this outline of Java program:

```
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ...
  }
}
```

Lines two and four are the start and end of a method.

We told you to ignore these lines (just type them) at the start of the course.

Now we will explain them (or at least partially).

## Explaining the method

The method you typed many times starts like this `public static void main(String[] args)`.

It contains

0. the word `public`
0. the word `static`
0. the word `void`
0. its name -- we will look at this later
0. an openening parenthesis, `(`
0. the text `String[] args` -- which we look at later
0. a closing parenthesis, `)`

Like `if` and `switch` statements methods are "blocks" of code. This means they start and end with curley brackets, `{` and `}`.
