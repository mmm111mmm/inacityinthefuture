# 8. Changing a float

We learnt how to declare a float variable. And we learnt how to assign value to that float variable.

We also learnt how to assign a value to a float variable multiple times.

**code sample 7.0**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    float score = 10.5;
    System.out.println(score);
    score = 11.0;
    System.out.println(score);
  }
}
```

We change float variables like we change int variables. There are differences, but we will look at them in a later lesson.

## Adding to a float with `+`

We can add to a float with `+`.

**code sample 7.1**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    float score = 10.5;
    System.out.println(score);
    score = score + 2.1;
    System.out.println(score);
  }
}
```

This outputs 

```
10.5
12.7
```

## Substrcting from a float with `-`

We can substract from a float with `-`.

**code sample 7.3**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    float score = 10.5;
    System.out.println(score);
    score = score - 2.1;
    System.out.println(score);
  }
}
```

This outputs 

```
10.5
8.4
```
