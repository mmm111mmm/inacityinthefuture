# 6. Changing a int

We learnt how to declare a int variable. And we learnt how to assign value to that variable.

We also learnt how to assign a value to a variable multiple times:

**code sample 7.0**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int age = 36;
    System.out.println(age);
    age = 112;
    System.out.println(age);
  }
}
```

## Adding to an int with `+`

We can add to an int with `+`.

**code sample 7.0**
```
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int age = 36;
    System.out.println(age);
    age = age + 10;
    System.out.println(age);
  }
}
```

This outputs 

```
36
46
```

## Adding to an int with `+=`

We saw the code `age = age + 10`.

This means

0. get the value of age (i.e. `36`)
0. add ten to that (i.e. `47`)
0. assign that to the variable `age`.

This is a very common thing to do. Java has a shortcut: age += 10.

For example this program

**code sample 7.1**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int age = 36;
    System.out.println(age);
    age += 10;
    System.out.println(age);
  }
}
```

outputs the same as the previous program:

```
36
46
```


## Substrcting from an int with `-`

We can substract from an int with `-`.

**code sample 7.2**
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int age = 36;
    System.out.println(age);
    age = age - 10;
    System.out.println(age);
  }
}
```

This outputs 

```
36
26
```

## Subtracting from an int with `-=`

We saw the code `age = age - 10`.

This means

0. get the value of age (i.e. `36`)
0. add ten to that (i.e. `27`)
0. assign that to the variable `age`.

This is a very common thing to do. Java has a shortcut: age -= 10.

For example this program

**code sample 7.3**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int age = 36;
    System.out.println(age);
    age -= 10;
    System.out.println(age);
  }
}
```

outputs the same as the previous program:

```
36
26
```

## Exercise

0. Start a new Java program on https://repl.it
0. Save this file as java_exercise_6_0 (click on the pen icon near the top left)
0. Write a program that: declares and assigns a your name to a string variable, prints that, adds the string " and Java" to the end, and finally prints that.

## Questions to answer

0. How do we concatenate a string to another value?
0. What is the long form of `name += "!";`?
